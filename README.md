This is my first repository in the GI-T9-SMUWIT organisation

I like Sleeping, Skating and Studying and there's so many s in what I like cus I'm SHUPER SPiDer man or at least that is what I convince myself to be. At this moment, putting code into this file befuddles me and I'm asking google for cool things to write her or many what do ordinary people write about their project. Either way, sleep really sounds great but this code does not condone such activities hence this shall be published and go into the email to WIT.

Time to breathe and be still, pray and hope that WIT peeps don't think I'm to much of a disappointment but yet I agree that it is my fault and have been in deep turmoil over it. It was really hard to leave my group for the pre-flutter workshop as there was last minute submission hiccups and everyone called off their appointments because we really gave it our all for the project in these first three weeks of school somehow -  with 2/3 am days and meetings everyday. It baffles me as I think about whether I could have have made a better choice or would thinking of this question leave me in a state of regrets. Such is an answer that I seek but it is also hard to ask for at the same time. Imaginations of somehow smuggling myself into cosy haven takes precidence as I internally stare blankly withholding a propensity for controlled anxiety.

Either ways, thoughts aside, 1am, I shall submit the screenshots and hope that it is satisfactory... pls pls pls be hehe
