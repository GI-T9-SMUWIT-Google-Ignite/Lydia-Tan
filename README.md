# Lydia-Tan_repo
This is my first repository in the GI-T9-SMUWIT organisation

I like Sleeping, Skating and Studying and there's so many s in what I like cus I'm SHUPER SPiDer man or at least that is what I convince myself to be. At this moment, putting code into this file befuddles me and I'm asking google for cool things to write here or many what do ordinary people write about their project. Either way, sleep really sounds great but this code does not condone such activities hence this shall be published and go into the email to WIT.
